# ClusterCraft: Redefining Customer Profiles

An MBA capstone project focused on segmenting customers using K-Means clustering to discover hidden behavioral patterns and drive data-driven marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how unsupervised machine learning—specifically, the K-Means clustering algorithm—can be used to segment customers based on behavioral data such as annual income, spending score, purchase frequency, and recency. The outcome enables businesses to personalize marketing efforts, increase customer retention, and optimize engagement strategies.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- To clean and preprocess customer behavioral data
- To apply K-Means clustering and determine optimal segment count
- To profile each customer segment based on meaningful traits
- To recommend targeted marketing strategies for each segment
